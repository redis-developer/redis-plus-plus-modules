## Introduction

This library aims to supply a C++ interface to all major/popular Redis modules.
It uses [redis-plus-plus](https://github.com/sewenew/redis-plus-plus), which
in turn uses [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis).

The following Redis Modules are fully implemented:

  - [BloomFilter](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Bloom_Commands/)
  - [CuckooFilter](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Cuckoo_Commands/)
  - [Count-Min-Sketch](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/Cuckoo_Commands/)
  - [Top-K](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/TopK_Commands/)
  - [RedisJSON](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisjson/commands/)

The following Redis Modules are in the process of being implemented:

  - [RedisGRAPH](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/commands/)

## Motivation

After using [redis-plus-plus](https://github.com/sewenew/redis-plus-plus)
for a while, one simply gets addicted to the ease of having proper
interfaces to Redis commands. These interfaces save a lot of
boiler-plate code and therefore a lot of time, and that's why I
decided to write this library.

## Design

The goal of this library is to use
[redis-plus-plus](https://github.com/sewenew/redis-plus-plus) and
[hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis) with no modification.
These two projects are included as git submodules and are built as
part of the final
[redis-plus-plus-modules](https://github.com/wingunder/redis-plus-plus-modules)
library.

[redis-plus-plus-modules](https://github.com/wingunder/redis-plus-plus-modules)
is a C++ library in the form of C++ headers, containing C++ template
classes. This means that there is no library to link with. The only
requirement is that one or more of the desired header files are
included:

  - [#include &lt;redismods++/BloomCuckooBase.h&gt;](include/redismods++/BloomCuckooBase.h)
  - [#include &lt;redismods++/BloomFilter.h&gt;](include/redismods++/BloomFilter.h)
  - [#include &lt;redismods++/CountMinSketch.h&gt;](include/redismods++/CountMinSketch.h)
  - [#include &lt;redismods++/CuckooFilter.h&gt;](include/redismods++/CuckooFilter.h)
  - [#include &lt;redismods++/RedisGraph.h&gt;](include/redismods++/RedisGraph.h)
  - [#include &lt;redismods++/RedisJSON.h&gt;](include/redismods++/RedisJSON.h)
  - [#include &lt;redismods++/TopK.h&gt;](include/redismods++/TopK.h)

## Building

[GNU/Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) is used as
building tool and g++ is used for building.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wingunder/redis-plus-plus-modules.git
cd redis-plus-plus-modules
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make -j8
```

Tests can be performed by running:
```shell
make test
```

## Quick start

First of all you'll need to have access to a Redis database with the
module(s) loaded, that you'd like to program against. The fastest way
to get started with this is to simply head off to
[redismod](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/redismod) and follow
their instructions to get a docker image installed and running, which
will supply this.

The following commands, adapted from the [RedisLabs redismod
docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/redismod) should start
a docker image that contains all relevant modules:

```console
$ docker pull redislabs/redismod
$ docker run -p 6379:6379 redislabs/redismod
```

Once your Redis database is set up and running, you can run the
`MODULE LIST` command on it:
```console
$ redis-cli MODULE LIST
1) 1) "name"
   2) "ai"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 10002
2) 1) "name"
   2) "ReJSON"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 10007
3) 1) "name"
   2) "bf"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 20205
4) 1) "name"
   2) "search"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 20006
5) 1) "name"
   2) "timeseries"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 10408
6) 1) "name"
   2) "rg"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 10006
7) 1) "name"
   2) "graph"
   3) "ver"
   4) (integer) 20402
```
In the above example, 7 modules are available. The 3rd module,
BloomFilter (bf), supplies BloomFilter (BF), CuckooFilter (CF),
Count-Min-Sketch (CMS) and Top-K (TOPK).

The `./test` directory contains test cases for all implemented API
calls. In order to run the tests, simply run:

```shell
make test
```

If you have gotten this far and the test succeeded, we can continue
with a simple example. For the impatient, just look at this
[example](examples/singleInfo/singleInfo.cpp) and the other examples
in the [examples directory](examples).

We're going to create a Redis instance, using redis-plus-plus:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <redismods++/BloomFilter.h>

int main() {

    // Setup the connection options.
    sw::redis::ConnectionOptions opts;
    opts.host = "127.0.0.1";
    opts.port = 6379;
    opts.password = "";

    // Choose the instance type.
    using RedisInstance = sw::redis::Redis;
    // use RedisInstance = sw::redis::RedisCluster;

    // Create a redis-plus-plus object.
    RedisInstance redis(opts);

    // Create a BloomFilter object.
    redis::module::BloomFilter<RedisInstance> bloomFilter(redis);

    getInfo<RedisInstance>("some_test_key", bloomFilter, redis);

    return 0;
}
```

Now we'll implement the getInfo() template function. BTW, it needs to
be a template function, as we're keeping the option open to use it on
non-clustered, as well as clustered Redis servers.

```C++
#include <unordered_map>

template <typename RedisInstance>
void
getInfo(const std::string &key,
        redis::module::BloomFilter<RedisInstance> &bloomFilter,
        RedisInstance &redis)
{
    // Make sure the key does not exist.
    // Note: The BloomFilter object does not have a 'del' call,
    //       so we need to call the native redis 'DEL' command
    //       via the underlying redis-plus-plus lib.
    redis.del(key);

    // Create a BloomFilter.
    bloomFilter.reserve(key, 0.1, 100, false);

    // Prepare the output buffer.
    std::unordered_map<std::string, sw::redis::OptionalLongLong> output;
    bloomFilter.info(key, output);

    // Print the result.
    for (auto &item : output) {
        std::cout << item.first << ": ";
        if (item.second) {
            std::cout << *item.second;
        }
        else {
            std::cout << "nil";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    // Clean up.
    redis.del(key);
}
```

We now need to compile it. Note that we need to linking in the hiredis,
redis++ and pthread libraries. The hiredis and redis++ libraries are
installed in the `${REDIS_PLUS_PLUS_MODULES_DIR}/lib` directory. All
include files are in the `${REDIS_PLUS_PLUS_MODULES_DIR}/include`
directory.

```console
$ g++ -I${REDIS_PLUS_PLUS_MODULES_DIR}/include -L${REDIS_PLUS_PLUS_MODULES_DIR}/lib -o singleInfo singleInfo.cpp -lhiredis -lredis++ -lpthread
```

Finally, we can run it:

```console
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib ./singleInfo
Expansion rate: 2
Number of items inserted: 0
Size: 232
Number of filters: 1
Capacity: 100
```

## Code Documentation

A [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) configuration file,
[DoxyFile](DoxyFile) is included, so you can simply [install
Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html) and run it:

```console
$ doxygen
```

The above should create an `html` and `latex` directory, where you can
find the generated Doxygen output files.
